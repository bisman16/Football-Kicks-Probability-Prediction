# Football-Kicks-Probability-Prediction
The dataset used for this program contains the record of all field goals that Melvin attempted in practice sessions and practice
matches. This program finds the Melvin's overall record and prediction regarding Melvin’s attemptsat field goals. 

This program also predicts the probability of Melvin scoring a goal when he kicks from 20, 40 and 60 yards in
practice sessions and practice matches. Using ggplot, we'll also plot the logistic models for his performance in matches as well as in practice in a single plot. 

# Results
1) Melvin’s overall success rate is 79.72%
2) Melvin’s goal success rate in matches is 82.2%. Melvin’s goal success rate in practice is 79.5%.
3) Melvin’s probability of goal success for 20, 40 and 60 yards is 0.972, 0.779 and 0.268 respectively.
4) Melvin’s probability of goal success for 20, 40 and 60 yards is 0.961, 0.830 and 0.490 respectively.
5) Probability of scoring a goal using ggplot -
